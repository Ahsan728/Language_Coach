# French Resources (Local)

Put your French learning PDFs and link lists in this folder.

- This folder is treated as **private input**: everything here is ignored by Git by default (see `.gitignore`).
- Keep PDFs/notes here locally; they won’t be pushed to GitHub.

In the app:
- Run `python scripts/build_resource_sentences.py` to build `data/resource_sentences.json` (local-only).
- This enables **Resource Drill** on the dashboard and extra **Context** questions in **Daily Practice**.
- Your resource files are **not displayed or served** by the web UI.
