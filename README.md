## 📸 Overview

A fully local language learning web application built in Python (Flask). Designed for Bengali/English speakers learning French and Spanish — covering vocabulary, grammar, and tenses with explanations in both Bengali and English. Inspired by Duolingo, aligned with the CEFR framework (A1 → A2 → B1 → B2).

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| 🇧🇩 Teaching language | Bengali + English |
| 🇫🇷 Target 1 | French (Français) — 28 lessons, CEFR A1–B1 |
| 🇪🇸 Target 2 | Spanish (Español) — 28 lessons, CEFR A1–B1 |
| 📖 Vocabulary | ~946 words per language across 27 categories |
| 📚 Grammar | Articles, Tenses, SER vs ESTAR — explained in Bengali |
| 🃏 Flashcards | Interactive flip cards with SRS tracking |
| 🧠 Quizzes | Multiple-choice with instant feedback + scoring |
| ⚡ Daily Practice | Duolingo-like mix: 🔊 listening, ✅ MCQ, ⌨️ typing, 🧩 sentence ordering |
| 🎧 Dictation | Hear a word → type what you heard (accent-tolerant) |
| 🔁 Spaced Repetition | Leitner box SRS: due-words review, weak-word review |
| 🔊 Pronunciation | Browser Text-to-Speech — no server API, works offline |
| 🔥 Streak + XP | Daily activity tracking with streak counter |
| 📊 Progress | Saved locally in SQLite (auto-created on first run) |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1 — Double Click (Windows)
Simply double-click **`start.bat`** in the project folder.
The browser will open automatically at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Option 2 — Command Line
```bash
# Install dependencies (first time only)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (One-time) Enable Bengali-perfect PDF downloads
python -m playwright install chromium

# Run the app
python app.py
```
Then open your browser at **http://localhost:5000**

## Online Deployment (Server TTS)

To make pronunciation work for everyone online (even if a user has no Spanish/French voice installed), use server-side TTS:

- Procfile deployments: server TTS is enabled by default (gTTS).
- Other hosts: set `TTS_PROVIDER=gtts` in your environment variables.
- Optional (recommended): set `TTS_CACHE_DIR` to a writable (or persistent) folder to cache generated MP3s.

Notes:
- gTTS requires outbound internet access from your server and sends text to Google to generate audio.
- If server TTS fails, the app automatically falls back to browser TTS.

## Local Resources (PDFs + Links)

- Add your learning PDFs/links into `French Resources/` and `Spanish Resources/` (kept local; ignored by Git).
- Build the sentence index (optional, safe to re-run after adding new PDFs):
  - `python scripts/build_resource_sentences.py`
- This creates `data/resource_sentences.json` (local-only).
- The app uses this file to power **Resource Drill** on the dashboard and extra **Context** questions in **Daily Practice** (your PDFs are not served in the web UI).

## Auto-push to GitHub (Optional)

Automatically commit + push whenever files change locally:

- Check what will be committed: `git status`
- Watch mode: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/auto_push.ps1`
- One-time sync: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/auto_push_once.ps1`
- Stop watch mode with `Ctrl+C`

Notes:
- Requires your GitHub auth to be set up for `git push` (HTTPS token or SSH).
- Resource folders and generated caches are ignored by default (see `.gitignore`).

## 📚 Lesson Plan — CEFR Structure

Lessons are organized by **CEFR level** and stored in `data/lessons.json`.

| Level | Lessons | Topics |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 🟢 **A1** — Elementary | 1–12, 15, 25–27 | Greetings, Numbers, Colors, Days, Family, Body, Food, Transport, Verbs, Adjectives, Grammar (Articles + Present), Phrases, Nationalities, Daily Activities, Hobbies |

| 🟠 **B1** — Intermediate | 23 | Food & Cooking Advanced |
| 🔴 **B2** — Upper Intermediate | — | Coming soon |

Aligned with **DELF** (French) and **DELE** (Spanish) international exam frameworks.

Each lesson references vocabulary categories from `data/vocabulary.json`.
The app **auto-reloads JSON** when files change — edit content while the server is running.

## 🗣️ Language Notes

### French Tips
- `bonjour` = hello/good morning | `bonsoir` = good evening
- Numbers 70–99 are irregular: `soixante-dix` (70), `quatre-vingts` (80)
- Every noun has gender (masculine/feminine) — memorize with the article!
- Past tense uses `avoir` OR `être` as helper verb
- Nationalities never capitalize in French: `Je suis français`

### Spanish Tips
- **SER** = permanent identity (`Soy de Bangladesh` — I am from Bangladesh)
- **ESTAR** = temporary state (`Estoy cansado` — I am tired)
- `mañana` means BOTH "tomorrow" AND "morning" — context decides!
- Reflexive verbs for daily routine: `me levanto`, `me ducho`, `me acuesto`
- Gustar-type verbs: `Me gusta viajar` · `Me encantan los libros`

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **Python 3.8+** (Python 3.13 tested ✓)
- **Internet** — only for Bootstrap & fonts (CDN); all learning content works offline

### Python packages
```
 flask>=3.0.0
 pypdf>=4.0.0
 cryptography>=3.1
 gunicorn>=21.0.0
 gTTS>=2.5.0
 ```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

The app runs on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

 - Change port: set the `PORT` environment variable.
   - PowerShell: `$env:PORT=8000`
   - cmd.exe: `set PORT=8000`

 - Server-side TTS (same pronunciation for everyone): set `TTS_PROVIDER=gtts`.
   - PowerShell: `$env:TTS_PROVIDER='gtts'`
   - cmd.exe: `set TTS_PROVIDER=gtts`
   - Audio is cached under `data/tts_cache/` (first play generates; next plays are instant).

## ☁️ Deployment — Share with Friends

Two recommended free options. **PythonAnywhere is the best choice** — always online, no sleep, SQLite data persists.

---

### 🥇 Option A — PythonAnywhere (Recommended — Free, Always On)

**Why:** Free forever · No spin-down · SQLite persists · 500 MB storage

#### Step 1 — Sign up
Go to [www.pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com) → **Create a Beginner account** (free)

#### Step 2 — Open a Bash console
Dashboard → **Consoles** → **Bash** → Start

#### Step 3 — Clone your repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahsan728/Language_Coach.git
cd Language_Coach
pip install -r requirements.txt --user
```

#### Step 4 — Create the Web App
Dashboard → **Web** → **Add a new web app** → **Manual configuration** → **Python 3.10**

#### Step 5 — Configure the WSGI file
Click the **WSGI configuration file** link and replace the contents with:
```python
import sys, os
project_home = '/home/ahsan728/Language_Coach'
if project_home not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, project_home)
from app import app as application
```
> ⚠️ Replace `ahsan728` with your actual PythonAnywhere username

#### Step 6 — Reload & visit
Web tab → green **Reload** button → your app is live at `https://ahsan728.pythonanywhere.com`

---

### 🥈 Option B — Render (Easy GitHub Auto-Deploy)

**Why:** Pushes to GitHub auto-deploy · Free · Sleeps after 15 min inactivity (30–50s to wake)
> ⚠️ SQLite resets on sleep — vocabulary and lessons work perfectly; quiz scores don't persist between sessions.

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Runtime** | Python 3 |
| **Build Command** | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| **Start Command** | `gunicorn app:app` |
| **Instance Type** | Free |

Every `git push` triggers an automatic redeploy.

---

### Comparison

| | PythonAnywhere | Render |
|--|---------------|--------|
| Cost | Free forever | Free |
| Always online | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Sleeps 15 min |
| SQLite persists | ✅ Yes | ❌ Resets on sleep |
| Auto-deploy from GitHub | Manual pull | ✅ Automatic |
| Best for | Permanent sharing | Quick demos |

---

### 🔄 Updating the live app

**PythonAnywhere:**
```bash
cd ~/Language_Coach && git pull
```
Then reload from the **Web** tab.

**Render:** just `git push` — deploys automatically within ~2 minutes.
