# Spanish Resources (Local)

Put your Spanish learning PDFs and link lists in this folder.

- PDF files are ignored by Git (see `.gitignore`).
- Small text/link files (e.g. `.txt`, `.md`) can be committed.

In the app:
- **Resources** page lists local PDFs/links.
- Run `python scripts/build_resource_sentences.py` to enable **Context** questions in **Daily Practice**.
